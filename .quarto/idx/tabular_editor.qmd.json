Visualization\n\n- The dependency visualization feature helps us understand relationships between tables, measures, and columns.\n- It is useful for identifying potential issues before making changes.\n\n### Diagram Mode\n\n- Diagram Mode offers a clear graphical overview of our data model, making it easier to communicate design choices and understand the overall structure.\n\n### C# Scripting\n\n- Tabular Editor supports C# scripting, which enables automation of repetitive tasks and customization of model management processes.\n- With C# scripts, we can batch-create measures, automate formatting, enforce naming conventions, and apply best practices across multiple models efficiently.\n- Leveraging C# scripting will be especially valuable for our future dashboard management, as it allows us to standardize processes, reduce manual errors, and accelerate development.\n- As our models grow in complexity, scripting will help us maintain consistency and implement changes at scale with minimal effort.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWatch this useful introduction video:  \n[Tabular Editor for Power
