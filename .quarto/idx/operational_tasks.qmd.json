Log in to Bloomreach to ensure both US and CA are covered for the entire week.\n    - [Bloomreach Analytics](https://app.exp.pandora.net/p/pandora-north-america/analytics/reports/64e4881683431ec3379aafc0) (Login with 'pandora' at Bloomreach Engagement if prompted.)\n    - Filter for the last week, ensuring CA is included. Download the CSV. Merge files if needed.\n    - Replace the US/CA data in your file with the newly retrieved data (including Canada).
